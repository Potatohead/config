# Note that the PBP book has a typo on page 35 when defining the above -wbb

# The above string is correct.

#----------  Perltidy default options (i.e. in line with PBP)  --------------
-add-semicolon    # Add any missing optional semicolon at the end of a line
-add-whitespace    # Add certain whitespace to improve code readability
-trim-qw    # Default handling of multi-line 'qw' quotes
-indent-block-comments    # Indent block comments to same level as the code
-minimum-space-to-comment=4  # Minimum 4 spaces between code and same-line comments
-fixed-position-side-comment=0 # Don't try to line up all comments to a fixed column
-hanging-side-comments    # Align hanging side comments
-static-block-comments    # Enable static block comments
-nssc   # No special handling for static side comments
-dnl    # Delete old newlines
#-bbc    # Ensure a blank line before every full-line comment
-nbbc    # Ensure no blank line before every full-line comment
-bbs    # Ensure a blank line before every sub definition (except one-liners)
-bbb    # Ensure a blank line before code blocks (for, while, if, ....)
-lbl=8  # Minimum number of lines between each -bbb inserted blank line

#-------------  Additional options, based on PBP recommendations  ------------
-nbl
-bar    # K&R style code braces
-nolc   # Long comments indented, even when this make the total line length "too long"
-noll   # Long lines indented, even when this make the total line length "too long"
-nola   # Don't treat labels as special cases when indenting

#----------  Options concerning Perltidy's input and ouput files  -----------
-nst    # Do NOT output to STDOUT (since we want to use -b)
-b      # Backup the input file to .bak and perform all tidying in the original file
-se     # Write errors to STDERR
-ple    # Preserve the EOL character(s). E.g. in case Perltidy runs
        # on Windows, but processes a Perl file for Unix (and vice versa)

#-----------  Some other Perltidy options, intentionally not used   ----------
-ce     # cuddled elses } else {
-skp    # space after perl builtins before parens

# The following Perltidy options are NOT consistent with PBP and should NOT be used:
# -lp, -icb, -fws, -nwls, -nwrs, -sfp, -sak/-nsak, -csc/dcsc, -fnl,
# -bl, -sbl, -bli, -blil, -bbvt, -otr, -sct, -boc, -kis,
# -pbp (because the -wbb list typo in the PBP book carried over to Perltidy (!))
# The following Perltidy options are not used, for other reasons:
# -sot, -mft, -cab, -bol, -bok/-nbok, -bot/-nbot, -iob, -isbc
